       <h2>TO KNOW NCC</h2>
       <p class="pg">NCC was firstly started in 1666 in Germany. The NCC in India was formed with the National Cadet Corps Act of 1948. It was raised on 15 July 1948. The origin of NCC can be traced back to the ‘University Corps’, which was created under the Indian Defence Act 1917, with the objective to make up the shortage of the Army. 
        In 1920, when the Indian Territorial Act was passed, the ‘University Corps’ was replaced by the University Training Corps (UTC). The aim was to raise the status of the UTC and make it more attractive to the youth. 
        The UTC Officers and cadets dressed like the army. It was a significant step towards the Indianisation of armed forces. It was rechristened in the form of UOTC so the National Cadet Corps can be considered as a successor of the University Officers Training Corps (UOTC) which was established by the British Government in 1942. 
        During World War II, the UOTC never came up to the expectations set by the British. This led to the idea that some better schemes should be formed, which could train more young men in a better way, even during peace. A committee headed by Pandit H.N. Kunzru recommended a cadet organization to be established in schools and colleges at a national level. 
        The National Cadet Corps Act was accepted by the Governor General and on 15 July 1948 the National Cadet Corps came into existence</p>
        
        <h2 style="color: brown;">CORE VALUES</h2>
        <p class="pg">The NCC is a responsive, learning and continuously evolving organization. Its activity is guided by certain Core Values that we endeavour to instill among all ranks of the NCC. These include the following:</p>
        <ul class="pg">
            <li> A sense of patriotic commitment to encourage cadets to contribute to national development.</li>
            <li>Respect for diversities in religion, language, culture, ethnicity, life style and habitat to instill a sense of National unity and social cohesion.</li>
            <li>  Abiding commitment to learn and adhere to the norms and values enshrined in the Indian Constitution.</li>
            <li> Understanding the value of a just and impartial exercise of authority.</li>
            <li>  Ability to participate in community development and other social programme.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 style="color: brown;">MOTTO OF NCC</h2>
        <p class="pg">The need for having motto for the Corps was discussed in the 11th Central Advisory Committee (CAC) meeting held on 11 Aug 1978.
           The mottos suggested were “Duty and Discipline”; “Duty, Unity and Discipline”; “Duty and Unity”;<b> “Unity and Discipline”</b>. The final decision for selection of “Unity and Discipline” as motto for the NCC was taken in the 12th CAC meeting held on 12 Oct 1980.</p>
